  Delete cloud's data

  This sketch demonstrate how to Access your data on Wilddog cloud
  using an Arduino YÃºn.

  A Wilddog account are necessary to run all Wilddog examples. 
  If you don't already have one, you can register for a free Wilddog account at 
  https://www.wilddog.com/ 
  
  In order to run this sketch, you'll need to creat an application using
  the Wilddog dashboard console at https://www.wilddog.com/dashboard. 
  After creating the app, you'll get an url which type following 
  https://YourAppId.wilddogio.com/
  Your data can add and save under that url,which will be access in this sketch. 

  Note that since this sketch will access your data on Wilddog cloud,
  your Arduino need to connect to the Internet first.
  
  uasge:
  1. Creat an application on  https://www.wilddog.com/dashboard. 
     This sketch will push an message {"pin13":"1"}  to the application your just build.    
  2. Modify YOURURL to your application.
  3. Upload to your Arduino.
  4. In your application ,You will see {"pin13":"1"} have beed delete by Arduino.
  
  
  This example code is in the public domain.
